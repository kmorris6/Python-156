# CHAPTER 1 EXERCISES - Each correct line of code is 1 point

# Create a variable named num1 and assign 15 to it
num1=15

# Create a variable named num2 and assign 6 to it
num2=6

# Add num1 to num2 and store it in ans_one, print ans_one
ans_one=num1+num2
print(ans_one)

# Subtract num2 from num1 and store it in ans_two, print ans_two
ans_two=num1-num2
print(ans_two)

# Multiply num1 by num2 and store it in ans_three, print ans_three
ans_three=num1*num2
print(ans_three)

# Divide num1 by num2 and store it in ans_four, print ans_four
ans_four=num1/num2
print(ans_four)

# Use integer division to divide num1 by num2 and store it in ans_five, print ans_five
ans_five=num1//num2
print(ans_five)

# Create a variable named time and assign 10.49 to it
time=10.49

# Create a variable named runner and assign Quaron Adams to it
runner='Quaron Adams'

# Print the following: 'Quaron Adams ran the 100 meters in 10.5 seconds.'
# You must include the variables in your print statement and format time with
# 1 digit to the right of the decimal point.
print(f'{runner} ran the 100 meters in {time:.1f} seconds')

# Use an input statement to prompt the user with text to enter a first name and store it in fname
fname=input('Enter your first name: ')

# Use an input statement to prompt the user with text to enter a last name and store it in lname
lname=input('Enter your last name: ')

# Print the first name and last name entered by the user with a space between the first name and last name
print(f'{fname} {lname}')

# Use an input statement to prompt the user with text to enter a floating point number and store it
# as a float in fnum using one line of code
fnum=float(input('Enter a decimal point number: '))
